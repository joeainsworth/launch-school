# In the last question we had the following classes:

class Greeting
  def greet(message)
    puts message
  end
end

class Hello < Greeting
  def hi
    greet("Hello")
  end
end

class Goodbye < Greeting
  def bye
    greet("Goodbye")
  end
end

# If we call Hello.hi we get an error message. How would you fix this?
# You could make the hi instance method a class method by changing it to self.hi so it can be called on the class not the object
